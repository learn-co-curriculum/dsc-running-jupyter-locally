As a computer user, you previously have probably sent commands to the computer through a graphical user interface (GUI) such as a web browser, text editor, photo editor, or any other of the myriad computer programs now in existence. While the command line is initially daunting with its cryptic looking text, we will quickly see some of the many advantages it can have.\n",

With these, or longer folder names, it can sometimes become cumbersome to type the full folder name. Instead, you can start typing the command and folder name such as `cd Dow` and then press **tab** to autocomplete. Like magic, the command line should complete the statement correctly to be `cd Downloads`. (Note: this will not work if you have another folder that begins with \"Dow\". Similarly, if you just typed `cd D` or `cd Do` followed by **tab**, the command line will not autocomplete, as the selection is not unique, because **D** or **Do** could both refer to either **Documents** or **Downloads**. Also note that these commands are case sensitive, and folder capitalization much be matched exactly."
